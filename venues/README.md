# Venue

The venue namespace is the used for the Venue Management software that is used by hotels, venues, and restaurants to manage Bookings for Group Food & Beverage, Meetings Space, Group Accommodation and Audio Visual.

Typical use cases for this API include:

* **Point of Sale** - Allow POS systems to post adhoc charges on the day of the event into iVvy in order to produce a final invoice and accurately report on the revenue for the booking.
* **Restaurant Bookings** - Allow iVvy to place group bookings into the dining booking tool to ensure that as group bookings are made the capacity for dining bookings is adjusted. Additionally, display run sheet for the floor staff.
* **Property Management Systems** - Allow iVvy to push group accommodation blocks into the PMS, and then place reservations into those blocks. 
* **Venue Signage** - Pull booking information on the day of the event to populate signage tools. Note: iVvy has an XML feed which may be an alternative for this uses case.
