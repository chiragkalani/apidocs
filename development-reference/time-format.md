# Time Format

The iVvy API uses a time format to represent time. The format is a simple text-based format in the following form:

hh:mm:ss

**Where**

* 'hh' is the 24-hour format of an hour with leading zeros. E.g. 09, 21
* 'mm' is the minute with leading zeros. E.g. 05, 55
* 'ss' is the second with leading zeros. E.g. 04, 44
